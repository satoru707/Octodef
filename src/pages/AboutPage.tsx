            <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                OctoDefender operates on a multi-agent architecture where eight
                specialized AI agents work in parallel to analyze potential
                cybersecurity threats. Each agent has a specific role and
                expertise, similar to how an octopus can perform multiple tasks
                simultaneously with its eight arms.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you submit threat data‚Äîwhether it&apos;s a suspicious URL,
                IP address, file hash, network log, or email header‚Äîall eight
                agents immediately begin their analysis. They communicate
                findings, share intelligence, and coordinate responses through
                the Orchestrator agent.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system processes threats in real-time, providing instant
                feedback on risk levels, identifying vulnerabilities, and
                suggesting remediation steps. You can also use the simulation
                mode to test the system against synthetic attacks.

            Octopi are masters of adaptation, problem-solving, and parallel
            processing. Each arm contains neurons that can act independently
            while remaining coordinated with the central brain. This biological
            marvel inspired our architecture‚Äîeight specialized agents that can
            analyze threats simultaneously while maintaining perfect
            synchronization through intelligent orchestration.
